# Rimworld Caravan speed fix [A17]
Alters speed of the caravan so that bionically enhanced (or crippled) 
pawns will fully influence caravan speed 
(in vanilla only base speed is affected, while terrain/seasonal modifiers are not changed).

Initial work is of koisama, who also have found the bug with the speed. I just rewrote his mod to A17 and changed it from detour into Harmony patch using Hugslib
